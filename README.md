# mentoring-the-kids
Teaching a few kids at local schools some coding basics such as git, github, html, css, javascript. 

This simple project will include creating your basic files from scratch, including html, css, javascript, and README.

In addition to this, we will conduct basic command line practice, and use of git and github so they become familiar managing their code and projects.

This is simply to help a few local students learn the basics of FrontEnd Development. After the basics, we will dive into more complex scenarios, libraries, etc.
